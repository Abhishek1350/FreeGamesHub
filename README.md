## Project Requirements

This project is built with the following requirements:

- Node v18.7.0
- NPM v8.15.0
- React v18.2.0
- TypeScript v4.9.5
- NextUI v2.2.9
- Tailwindcss v3.3.5

For more information, please see the [**package.json**](package.json) file.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies required for the project.

## Usage

To run the project, ensure you have the necessary environment variables set. Refer to the [**.env.example**](.env.example) file for the required variables. Four of them are already provided and can be used as-is. However, you need to obtain the **REACT_APP_GAMES_API_KEY** from [**RapidAPI**](https://rapidapi.com/hub). Once you have the key, create a **.env** file in the root directory and paste all the variables there. You can use the provided variables in .env.example as a template for your .env file.

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the app in the localhost:3000 if the port is available.

## Usage/Examples

This app is built with Functional Components and Hooks, also using [**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) for state management and data fetching with [**RTK Query**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview).

#### Creating a new page/component

You can create a new page in **src/containers** folder. For example, **ExamplePage.tsx**. You can import the page in **src/App.tsx** and add the route for the page. Similarly, you can create a new component in **src/components** folder. For example, **ExampleComponent.tsx**. Later you can import it anywhere you want. Please check any existing page/component for reference.

```javascript
export const Example = () => {
  return <div>I am a component/Page</div>;
};
```

#### Styling

CSS can be used by **global styles** or by using **CSS modules**.  
We're also using [**NextUI**](https://nextui.org) and [**Tailwindcss**](https://tailwindcss.com/).

#### Global Styles

You can modify existing global stylesheet **App.css**.  
**Note - Utilize [NextUI](https://nextui.org) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) whenever possible.**

#### CSS Modules

CSS modules can used by creating a new stylesheet with **.module.css** extension. For example, **Example.module.css**. You can import the stylesheet in the component and use it as shown below.  
**Note - Utilize [NextUI](https://nextui.org) and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) whenever possible.**

```javascript
import { Button } from "@nextui-org/react";
import Styles from "./Example.module.css";

export const Example = () => {
  return (
    <Button color="primary" className={Styles.button}>
      Click Me
    </Button>
  );
};
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

**Important: Utilizing react-snap for pre-rendering the application to enhance SEO. It's possible to encounter issues during the app-building process. If you face any challenges, consult the official react-snap [documentation](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap) for guidance. I encountered problems while attempting to build the app on a Linux machine, primarily due to the absence of Chrome installation. Additionally, when using Vite, be aware that the build directory differs. Usually you are not going to have any problems untill you modify something. Once again, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap) for assistance.**

**Quick fix if you don't want to mess up with react-snap issues : Just remove it.**
